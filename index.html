        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Internships offer practical work experience related to a student's field of study, allowing for career
          exploration and skill development. They can be paid or unpaid, and typically last between one and four months,
          but
          can be shorter or longer depending on the organization. A quality internship provides a clear job description,
          orientation to the workplace, and regular feedback to the intern.
