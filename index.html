    <h1>What Is an Internship?</h1><br>
    <p>An internship is a professional learning experience that offers meaningful, practical work related to a student’s
      field of study or career interest. An internship gives a student the opportunity for career exploration and
      development, and to learn new skills. It offers the employer the opportunity to bring new ideas and energy into
      the workplace, develop talent and potentially build a pipeline for future full-time employees. A quality
      internship:</p><br>

    <ul>
      <li>Consists of a part-time or full-time work schedule that includes no more than 25% clerical or administrative
        duties.</li>
      <li>Provides a clear job/project description for the work experience.</li>
      <li>Orients the student to the organization, its culture and proposed work assignment(s).</li>
      <li>Helps the student develop and achieve learning goals.</li>
      <li>Offers regular feedback to the student intern.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>What is the difference between an internship, cooperative education (co-op), and research experience?</h4><br>
    <h3>Duration</h3><br>
    <p>Cognifyz Technologies internships typically last for 4 weeks (one month). They offer virtual internships with flexible schedules, allowing participants to work at their own pace while receiving support and mentorship according to Cognifyz Technologies. The duration can vary slightly depending on the specific internship program. For example, some internship programs, like the one offered for Power BI, Data Science, Machine Learning, Java Development, Web Development, and Python Development, can be for 1, 2, or 3 months. </p><br>
    <p><h4 style="display: inline;">Internships</h4> are supervised, structured learning experiences in a professional setting that allow you to gain valuable work experience in a student’s chosen field of study. Internships require a minimum of 120 hours (typically, at least 10 hours per week during the fall and spring and either part-time or full-time during the summer).</p><br>
    <p><h4 style="display: inline;">Co-ops</h4> are paid positions that require students to alternate semesters between full-time work during the academic term and full-time academic study for at least two semesters. Students are often, but not always, offered full-time employment with the organization upon graduation.  Co-ops are not common at UMBC, but there are students who are interested in them as applied learning experiences.  If you are interested in a co-op, we recommend speaking with one of our staff to develop a structure for the experience that will be the most workable for our students.</p><br>
    <p><h4 style="display: inline;">Research opportunities</h4> are available both on- and off-campus. These experiences offer a unique way to better understand a student’s academic interests and consider how graduate school may play a role in future paths. Funding may be available for these experiences through organizations like the National Science Foundation (NSF).</p><br>
